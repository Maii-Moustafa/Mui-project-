            To avoid your bossâ€™s staring eye, you should not roll your eyes to
            check the time. The Time Tag Watch is a consummately appropriate for
            it. Those tags do the role of the hands of the watch. By rotating
            the face of the watch not the hands, it gets harder to be damaged.
            It provides you with experience to feel the time at the end of your
            finger without damaging your watch.
